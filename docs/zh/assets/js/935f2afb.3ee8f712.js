Those web frameworks render the HTML DOM UI using the WebAssembly, compiled from Rust source code. They use wasm-bindgen to tie the Rust to the HTML DOM. While these frameworks send .wasm files to the browser to render the UI on the client side, some provide the additional choice for Server-side rendering.
